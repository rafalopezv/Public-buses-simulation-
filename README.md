# About

- The original idea was: If the local government collected data on public bases in La Paz Bolivia we could imporove the service: recalculating routes, red lights, etc
- There waas no data, so the onluy way ws to simulate the data based on personal experience tracking times for one route
- Times registeres were then used to build a simulation on a uniform distribution reflecting delays, such as, protests, peak hours, etc

# Implementation

- Later on, the project wsa presented and approved by the municipal gobvernment. 
- Initially 53K data sets were organized to create a more efficient way of collecting data
